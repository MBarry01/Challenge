                    <h1>Maduro makes a mockery of democracy ‚Äî and Latin America's left goes along for the ride</h1>
                    <p>
                        With a sham court ruling, Venezuela's President Nicol√°s Maduro has paved the way for his unchallenged reelection as president this year, regardless of U.S. sanctions. This is happening as Latin America's leftist governments, notably Brazil, watch in silence, writes Marcelo Cantelmi in Argentine daily Clar√≠n.

                        The brutality of Venezuela's socialist regime is usually a measure of its weakness. Seemingly as its prospects worsen, it has returned, instinctively, to the tried-and-tested formula of ruling by force.

                        It is how the so-called Bolivarian revolution has run Venezuela for 25 years. And its claims of being revolutionary and ruling for the people are merely to allow it the type of rights violations immediately pounced on should they occur in any right-wing regime. Like this last one: without a peep from anyone in Latin America, Venezuela's commissar-filled Supreme Court banned the government's chief opponents, notably the leading presidential aspirant Mar√≠a Corina Machado, from running for public office.

                        This was a crass reversal of the regime's earlier bid to ingratiate itself with the United States and give the economy a breather. A conditional agreement in October (to allow opponents to compete in elections) broadly alleviated U.S. sanctions, allowing business to pick up a little, before this return to the "Nicaraguan" path of brazen despotism. Here President Nicol√°s Maduro chose to heed the counsels of hardliners led by the deputy-head of the ruling party and captain in the Armed Forces, Diosdado Cabello.

                        The volte-face has been justified with the usual litany of claims on attempted coups and CIA plots to murder Maduro. It's the side dish in a familiar recipe.

                        The reason was the regime's sullen realism. It is the first time that elections could sweep away ‚Äî or bring crashing down ‚Äî the socialist edifice its ideologue, the late Hugo Ch√°vez, began raising in 1999. The regime was already showing restlessness when it revived months ago a 19th century dispute over Esequibo, an oil-rich chunk of land inside neighboring Guyana. Threatening to march into the territory was a jingoistic ploy any troubled regime would try, especially as Venezuelans already believe Esequibo is 'rightly' part of their country.

                        Esequibo is a little like our drama with the Falkland Islands, which we call Malvinas, although Guyana became independent of Great Britain in 1966 and the land dispute is now with the International Court at The Hague. Perhaps it is more like Kuwait, the oil-drenched emirate Iraq's dictator Saddam Hussein briefly annexed in 1990. He was hoping, in vain, to solve Iraq's dismal economic conditions in one fell swoop. Likewise Maduro may envisage he could bankroll a Bolivarian renaissance with Esequibo's resources. Thanks to those, Guyana's economy grew 57.8% in 2022, and 29.2% in 2023. Thus he held a referendum on Dec. 3 wherein voters were asked to reaffirm this claim, though its chief result turned out to be their abstention.

                        Less than 10% of almost 21 million eligible voters voted that day, which is fewer than the disciplined opposition supporters who voted last June to make Machado the opposition's single candidate at the presidential elections due this year. The regime previously received a slap in the face in the 2022 local elections in the state of Barinas, Ch√°vez's birth state, where the opposition won. Rather, two slaps: the Supreme Court annulled the results, ordered a repeat with other opposition candidates, and the opposition won again! [...]

                        Tel Aviv-based daily Israel Hayom devotes its front page to the emotional reunion after two Israeli hostages were rescued yesterday in Rafah, in southern Gaza. Israel‚Äôs special counterterrorism unit managed to free Fernando Marman and Louis Har, who had been abducted from the Nir Yitzhak kibbutz when Hamas launched its Oct. 7 attack. This is the second time since the beginning of the war between Israel and Hamas that security forces have succeeded in rescuing living hostages from Gaza.

                    <h2>üì∞ STORY OF THE DAY</h2>
                    <h2>How the Centre Pompidou's original sketches were rediscovered ‚Äî in a parking lot</h2>
                    <p>
                        In Turin-based daily La Stampa, Andrea Plebe reports on the discovery of four hundred tubes that tell the story of the architectural adventure of the making of the iconic post-modern Centre Pompidou, which is about to undergo a major renovation project as its 50th anniversary approaches.<br><br>

                        üìÑ "It was like entering Ali Baba's cave..." Boris Hamzeian, an architect and architectural history and theory scholar, was born in Sestri Levante, Italy, to a family of Iranian descent. But the mysterious "cave" in question was in Paris, hidden inside the parking lot next to the Centre Georges Pompidou. There were 400 tubes, containing the original drawings of the revolutionary project with which Renzo Piano, Richard Rogers and Gianfranco Franchini, then in their early 30s, submitted the winning bid to design and build an icon of 20th-century architecture.<br><br>

                        üèóÔ∏è The Beaubourg marks a watershed in the conception of museums: no longer courtly, intimidating buildings, the expression of a dusty, academic culture, but instead a center that aimed to be open to as many people as possible. A kind of cultural factory descended upon the center of the French capital, with its green, yellow, blue and white exterior tubes, plus red to indicate the paths and escalators on the main facade. Some people called it pejoratively at the time the "Notre Dame of tubes."<br><br>

                        ü•á The competition was announced in 1971, the inauguration was held on January 31, 1977 with the intervention of the President of the Republic, Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing (Georges Pompidou, who conceived the idea and after whom the center is named, had died in 1974): 5,000 people were expected, 30,000 arrived. On July 15, 1971, when the name "Piano & Rogers" was read out by the chairman of the competition jury, Jean Prouv√©, as the designated winners from among 681 proposals received from 41 countries around the world, no one had any idea who they were.<br><br>
